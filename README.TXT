Part I: number-display project

2. A class diagram will change when you add, remove or modify either classes, fields or methods

3. An object diagram changes when you create, delete objects or if their attributes are changed

4. Instructor tutor;   //name is tutor, object of type Instructor

6. When the minutes display reaches 60, it will rollover to 0. Then the hours display 
should go up by one.

8. Only the first call of setValue actually changed the value.
   If the value you put in is lesser than the limit, it'll set the value to that number.
   If the value you put in is higher than the limit, it won't change the value and keep it
   at the current value.
   
9. The limit is the rollOverLimit, which you declare when creating the object. If you call
   setValue() and the value is greater or equal to the limit, it won't change anything.
   
11. You don't need to put "int" in the parentheses. Int is the data type in the code.
    So for it to work, you just have to put a value that is of type int.
    
13. 0

14. negative numbers or any number equal or greater than the limit

15. !false
    (34 != 33) && !false
    
16. ((a == true) && (b == true)) || ((a == false) && (b == false))

17. ((a == true) && (b == false)) || ((a == false) && (b == true))

19. It takes out the ""

20. The first prints out "12cat"
    The second prints out "cat39"
    If java sees string first, what comes after will be text, so no math operations
